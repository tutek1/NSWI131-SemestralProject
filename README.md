# NSWI131-Semestral-Project

This repository contains performance comparison of two version of a compute shader pipeline for generating Normal Maps from Images.

- The folder `src` contains all source files (old and new compute shaders, measuring script, etc.)
- The folder `img` contains source images and the resulting generated normal maps.

This repository is a semestral project for **Peformance Evaluation of Computer Systems** course taught at **Charles University**.
